# LaunchCraft

LaunchCraft is a utility tool for Linux desktop environments that helps manage application icons (AppIcon) for AppImage files and website shortcuts.

## Features

- Create desktop entries (.desktop files) for AppImage applications
- Generate website shortcuts with custom icons
- Simple shell script based solution
- Multi-language support (English/Korean)
- Flatpak browser detection (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, etc.)
- Multi-desktop environment support (GNOME, KDE Plasma)

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x launchcraft.sh
```

2. Run the script with AppImage file or URL:
```bash
# For AppImage
./launchcraft.sh /path/to/your/application.AppImage

# For website shortcut
./launchcraft.sh https://example.com

# With Korean language option
./launchcraft.sh -l ko /path/to/your/application.AppImage
```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to:
   - Choose installation location (Dock/Desktop/Both)
   - For AppImage: When the app launches, click its window with the crosshair (+) cursor to set the correct window class

## Notes

- Window Detection: The script needs to detect the application window class for proper integration. When prompted, click the application window with the crosshair cursor.
- Language: The script automatically uses Korean if your system locale is Korean, English otherwise. You can override this with the -l option.
- Permission: When registering a URL shortcut, set the execution permission by right-clicking on the desktop icon and selecting "Properties".

## Examples

* GPU-related errors may appear but can be safely ignored. The application will work correctly.

These screenshots show:
1. Some GPU-related errors may appear but the application works correctly
2. The crosshair cursor will appear to detect the application window

### Adding a website shortcut
